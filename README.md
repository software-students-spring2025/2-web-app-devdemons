# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

Park Passport is an application that allows users to explore and share their experiences at US National Parks while keeping track of the parks they have visited. 

## User stories

1. As a traveler, I want to be able to sign up for the application so that I can see other people's national park information.
2. As a traveler, I want to be able to log into my own account so that I can see where all my national park destinations are stored.

3. As a traveler, I want to have an organized list of national parks so I can explore new national parks.

4. As a traveler, I want to keep track of all of the national parks I have been to so that I can plan better for future travels.

5. As a traveler, I want to upload reviews of my experience at the national parks so that I can share my experience with others.

6. As a traveler, I want to be able to see whether national parks are free or have an entry fee so that I can plan ahead and budget.

7. As a traveler, I want to be able to see generally how many reviews other users have posted so that I can know how much they've traveled and use that to interpret their reviews.
